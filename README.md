# Implementation of TCP Delayed Congestion Response (DCR) in ns-3
##Course Code: CS821
##Assignment:  #FP8 

###Overview

TCP-DCR [1] is an TCP extension for wireless networks. It is based on the simple idea of allowing the link-level mechanism to recover the packets lost, due to channel errors, thereby limiting the response of the transport protocol to mostly congestion losses. This repository contains an implementation of TCP-DCR in ns-3 [2].
